Europe
Guiana Space Centre, Kourou, French Guiana
Operational since 1968, this European spaceport is located near the equator, providing an ideal location for geostationary launches.

Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia
Active since 1966, Plesetsk is primarily used for military and commercial satellite launches into polar and sun-synchronous orbits.

Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan
The world's first and largest operational space launch facility, Baikonur has been active since 1957 and is known for launching the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into space.

Asia
Tanegashima Space Center, Japan
Established in 1969, this is Japan's largest rocket-launch complex, handling satellite launches and interplanetary missions.

Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, India
Operational since 1971, this is the primary launch center for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), supporting a range of satellite and exploratory missions.

Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, China
Active since 1958, Jiuquan is China's oldest launch facility, supporting both crewed and uncrewed missions.

Oceania
Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand
Operational since 2017, this private launch site is used by Rocket Lab for launching small satellites into orbit.
Africa
Broglio Space Centre, Malindi, Kenya
Established in the 1960s, this sea-based platform has been used for launching satellites into equatorial orbits.
These launch sites play pivotal roles in global space exploration, satellite deployment, and scientific research. Their strategic locations and specialized facilities enable a wide range of missions that advance our understanding of space and technology.

                Russia, officially known as the Russian Federation, is the world's largest country, spanning Eastern Europe and northern Asia. It covers an area of approximately 17,098,246 square kilometers, encompassing a diverse range of landscapes and climates. The capital city is Moscow, which serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of the nation.

Geography and Climate

Russia's vast expanse includes a variety of geographical features, from the lowland plains of the Russian Plain in the west to the mountainous terrains in the east. Major mountain ranges include the Ural Mountains, which traditionally mark the boundary between Europe and Asia, and the Caucasus Mountains to the south. The country is also home to extensive river systems, such as the Volga, Lena, and Amur rivers. 
BRITANNICA.COM

The climate varies significantly across Russia. While much of the country experiences a continental climate with cold winters and warm summers, the northern regions are characterized by subarctic and tundra climates, and the southern areas can have more temperate conditions.

Demographics and Language

As of 2024, Russia has an estimated population of approximately 146 million people, making it the ninth most populous country globally. The official and most widely spoken language is Russian. The nation is ethnically diverse, with ethnic Russians constituting about 71.7% of the population. Other significant ethnic groups include Tatars, Bashkirs, and Chechens.

Government and Politics

Russia operates as a federal semi-presidential republic. The President serves as the head of state, while the Prime Minister is the head of government. As of February 2025, Vladimir Putin holds the presidency, and Mikhail Mishustin is the Prime Minister. The country's legislature is the Federal Assembly, comprising two chambers: the Federation Council (upper house) and the State Duma (lower house). 
EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG

Economy

Russia possesses a high-income economy, ranking as the eleventh-largest globally by nominal GDP and fourth-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). The economy heavily relies on its vast natural resources, particularly in oil and natural gas production, where it stands as one of the world's leading producers. Other significant industries include mining, manufacturing, and agriculture.

Recent Developments

In February 2025, Presidents Trump and Putin held their first meeting since the onset of the Ukraine conflict. The discussions aimed at restoring relations and negotiating an end to the war, covering key issues such as territorial disputes, NATO relations, energy cooperation, sanctions, and nuclear arms control.

                alt="Image 7">Origins and Evolution
Dogs (scientifically Canis lupus familiaris) are descendants of wolves (Canis lupus), and their journey with humans is a long one. The exact when and where is still debated, but archaeological evidence‚Äîlike a 14,700-year-old jawbone from Germany‚Äîpoints to domestication starting at least 15,000 years ago. Some genetic studies push it even further, suggesting a split from wolves as early as 40,000 years back, possibly in East Asia or Europe. The process likely began when less aggressive wolves started hanging around human camps, scavenging leftovers. Over generations, humans favored the friendlier ones, kickstarting a partnership.

From there, selective breeding went wild. Ancient societies shaped dogs for specific jobs: guarding in Mesopotamia, hunting in Egypt, herding in Europe. By the 19th century, breed standards got formalized, and today, groups like the American Kennel Club recognize over 197 breeds, while the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale counts 340+. These range from the 2-pound Teacup Yorkie to the 200-pound English Mastiff.

Biology and Senses
Dogs are built differently depending on their breed, but they share some core traits that blow humans out of the water. Let‚Äôs start with the nose: a dog‚Äôs sense of smell is 10,000 to 100,000 times stronger than ours. They‚Äôve got up to 300 million olfactory receptors (we‚Äôve got a measly 6 million), and a chunk of their brain is dedicated just to decoding scents. That‚Äôs why a bloodhound can track a days-old trail over miles or a beagle can sniff out contraband in a suitcase.

Their hearing‚Äôs another marvel. Dogs pick up sounds from 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz‚Äîway beyond our 20,000 Hz limit. They can hear a whistle four times farther away than we can and detect high-pitched sounds we don‚Äôt even register. Their ears, especially in breeds like German Shepherds, can swivel independently to zero in on a noise.

Vision‚Äôs more of a mixed bag. Dogs see better in low light thanks to a reflective layer behind their retinas (the tapetum lucidum), which gives their eyes that glow-in-the-dark look. But they‚Äôre color-limited‚Äîmostly blues and yellows, no reds‚Äîand their sharpness is weaker than ours, though they‚Äôre aces at spotting movement. A greyhound, for instance, can clock a rabbit darting 300 yards away.

Physically, they‚Äôre diverse. A Dachshund‚Äôs stubby legs and long spine are bred for digging into badger burrows, while a Saluki‚Äôs lean frame and deep chest scream speed‚Äîup to 40 mph. Lifespan varies too: smaller breeds like Chihuahuas can hit 15-20 years, while giants like Great Danes average 6-8.

Behavior and Social Smarts
Dogs are wired for social living. As pack animals, they thrive on hierarchy and connection, which is why they slot so neatly into human families. They read us like pros‚Äîstudies from places like the Max Planck Institute show they can distinguish our emotions via facial cues, tone, even body language. Ever notice how your dog knows you‚Äôre sad before you say a word? That‚Äôs not an accident. They‚Äôve got a knack for empathy, sometimes even mirroring our stress or calming us with a nuzzle.

Communication‚Äôs a two-way street with them. That tail wag? It‚Äôs nuanced‚Äîfast and wide usually means excitement, slow and stiff might signal tension, and a left-leaning wag can mean unease, while right-leaning‚Äôs more positive (yep, brain hemispheres play a role). Barks, whines, and growls all shift pitch and rhythm to convey hunger, alertness, or play. And those puppy eyes? They‚Äôve evolved bigger eye muscles over millennia to mimic human expressions, tugging at our heartstrings.

Training‚Äôs where their intelligence shines. Border Collies, often dubbed the smartest breed, can learn over 1,000 words and commands‚Äîthink Chaser, the famous Collie who knew toy names like a linguist. But even ‚Äúless smart‚Äù breeds like Basset Hounds have their own genius, like stubborn focus on a scent trail. They‚Äôre adaptable, loyal, and wired to please, though some (looking at you, Huskies) love testing boundaries.
